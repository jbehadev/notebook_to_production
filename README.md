# notebook_to_production

This repository main purpose is to support a future blog post. 

It evolves from several iterations from a Jupyter notebook into a Python class with inheritance, designed to show how to make traditional machine learning models production-ready.

To run the various python programs:

```
mkdir models
mkdir predictions
python titanic_prediction_step_1.py
python titanic_prediction_step_2.py
python titanic_prediction_step_3.py
python titanic_prediction_step_4.py
```

Requirements:  
scikit-learn  
xgboost  
pandas  
numpy  
matplotlib
